**Description:** The Focus Chrome Extension removes distracting content from popular websites like Yahoo.com and YouTube.com. When you visit these sites, you are often overwhelmed with content that makes you forget what you were looking for in the first place. Focus mode deals with this problem by hiding distracting content by manipulating the DOM.

**How to install on your computer:** Copy code from Github repository to VS code. Go to chrome://extensions/ and turn on developer mode. Then click the load unpacked button and select the chrome extension folder. It should now be installed.

**How to use:** There is a popup in the right hand side of the browser with which you can turn on and off the extension.
